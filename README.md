DJSng's Toolkit is a collection of resources I have compiled over the years, mainly built from personal experience. It mainly focuses on video game and software, and was inspired by some "awesome" lists on GitHub. The name of the project comes from a private, vanilla compatible Minecraft modpack I created to share with friends.

This bundle of resources is inspired by many projects and community made resources, including:
* Various Neocities users' Resource Pages
* FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH
* TheUsefulLists
* "Awesome" list projects on GitHub
* ...and many more!
