DJSng's Toolkit is a personal library of resources for various topics created by DJSng, intended to provide casual internet browsers with many resources. It is very similar to (and inspired by) many projects and community made resources, including:
* Various Neocities users' Resource Pages
* FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH
* TheUsefulLists
* "Awesome" list projects on GitHub
* ...and many more!

DJSng's Toolkit (named after a private vanilla modpack started by the founder months prior) is an GitHub organization that hosts resources curated by [DJSng](https://djsng.neocities.org) as a personal library of resources they've collected over the years. This organization is meant to host resources and other DJSng's Toolkit related projects, including the self-named "Toolkit" project.
